* newDotFiles

  This is where i keep my dotfiles and scripts.

** Dotfile management

   I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] for dot file management. This splits the dotfiles into multiple modules, 
   for example can zsh be installed without installing dwm.

   To install a package or module one can run.

   : stow emacs
