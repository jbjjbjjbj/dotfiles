* newDotFiles

  This is where i keep my dotfiles and scripts.

** Dotfile management

   I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] for dot file management. This splits the dotfiles into multiple modules, 
   for example can zsh be installed without installing dwm.

   To install a package or module one can run.

   : stow emacs

** Stows script

	This scripts runs pre and post setup scripts. 

	These scripts are in encased in # because it's in stow's default ignore :-D. 

	To use the wrapper script run.

	: stows emacs

	To pass flags to package scripts put them before the package

	: stows vim -D emacs

	This will setup vim and delete emacs.
